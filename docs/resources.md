Here you find currated lists of resources worth considering to support a journey towards deep understanding of C. (Warning: I would not recommend this stuff to programmers just starting their journey into learning C)

#### Books about C (in no particular order):

- [The C Programming Language (1978), Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780131101630) - an absolute masterpiece that defined the standard for how to write books about computer programming. At the time, it was also the only proper reference for the C programming language. While the version of C described and the syntax used in the book is dated, it is still just a wonderful book that every hardcore C programmer should read.
- [The C Programming Language (1988, 2nd ed), Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9798477772476) - any serious C programmer must read this book - not only once, but regularly. 30+ years later, it is (unfortunately) still the best book every written about C.
- [Expert C Programming - Deep C Secrets (1994), Peter van der Linden](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/0131774298) - To me, this was the eyeopener and a first step into a a deeper understanding of C. Indeed, it was the main inspiration for the Deep C slides, and therefore also a main inspiration for this site.
- [Effective C (2020), Robert C. Seacord](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781718501041) - Lots of books have been written about C the last few years, but this one stands out as a really nice and proper book about the C programming language. Highly recommeneded, and a very good (re-)introduction to the C programming language for those who already know another programming language well. It is precise in the wording and have direct references into the C standard.
- [The C Standard (2003), The British Standards Institution](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/0470845732) - It is just a reprint of available text, but still it is nice to have it collected in a physical book. In particular Section A, The C Rationale, is extremely important to be familiar with IMHO.
- [BCPL: The Language and its Compiler (1979), Martin Richards and Colin Whitby-Strevens](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/0521219655) - As you probably know, the original C, and before that B, was basically just a syntactic reimplementation of BCPL. Semantically C is very simlar to BCPL, and many of the core ideas came from Martin Richards and his BCPL language. This book is an eye opener when trying to understand where many of the clever ideas implemented in C comes from.
- [The New C Standard (2002), Derek M. Jones](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/0201709171) - this book had a publisher, and an ISDN number, but was never actually published. An updated version is available [online](http://www.coding-guidelines.com/cbook/cbook1_2.pdf). It is a strange, but very fascinating and educational book. Derek carefully studied every sentence in the C99 standard (about 160 pages), with elaborated commentaries and comparisons to C99 - and he ends up with a book of more than 1600 pages.
- [The Design and Evolution of C++ (1994), Bjarne Stroustrup](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/0201543303) - you might be surprised to find a C++ book on this list, but the impact of C++ and Bjarne Stroustrup has had on the evolution of the C programming language is very undercommunicated. It is worth knowing that the C standardization process (ANSI C) was largely driven by a need to enable C++ to be standardized.
- [The Linux Programming Interface (2010), Michael Kerrisk](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781593272203) - 1500+ pages packed with high quality C code in a very specific and relevant context. If learning by real examples is relevant to you, then studying this book is definitely worth it.
- [UNIX - A History and a Memoir (2020), Brian Kernighan](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781695978553) - C and Unix grew together and escaped the Bell Labs to conquer the world. This book tells the story well and includes a lot of useful background information for those studing the history and spirit of C.
- [Test Driven Development for Embedded C (2011), James W. Grenning](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781934356623) - a well written book about modern development techniques also in a programming language like C.

#### Conferences about C (in no particular order):

- [ACCU](https://www.accuconference.org/) - ACCU was originally an acronym for Association of C and C++ users. The annual ACCU conference has C and C++ at its core. It is usually running in April in Bristol, UK.
- [NDC TechTown](https://ndctechtown.com/) - This annual conference in Norway is focusing on software development for products, and C and C++ has a very central role. The conference usually runs in September in Kongsberg, Norway.

#### Websites about C (in no particular order):

- [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c) - The best online reference for C++, but also for C. High quality examples, and precise wording.
- [godbolt.org](https://godbolt.org/z/ceGWd1v5v) - A fantastic tool when you want to study C carefully. Here you can see and compare assembler code produced by different compilers and the effect of changing compilation flags or language versions.
- [comp.lang.c FAQ](https://c-faq.com/) - a bit dated, but still very relevant FAQ about the C programming language
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) - a very useful and usually up to date overview of the C programming language.

#### Legends of C (in no particular order):

- [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie) - the creator of C
- [Ken Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson) - the creator of B and creator of Unix, worked closely with Dennis M. Ritchie and is, at least indirectly, a co-creator of C.

#### Trivia and fun stuff related to C

- [Recreating Dennis Ritchhie's PhD Thesis -Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82TxNejKsng) - an amusing story about the unsubmitted PhD thesis by Dennis Ritchie.
- [UNIX: Making Computers Easier To Use -- AT&T Archives film from 1982, Bell Laboratories](/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvDZLjaCJuw) - C and Unix grew up together. Most of the tools that Brian talks about in this video is probably, or could have been, implemented in C.
